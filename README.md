My trimps need a mighty ruler but in order to do my job I have to also do my job. So because of this I have the help of a certain automation script doing some of the legwork for me.

var script = document.createElement('script');
script.id = 'AutoTrimps-Zek';
script.src = 'https://Zorn192.github.io/AutoTrimps/AutoTrimps2.js';
script.setAttribute('crossorigin',"anonymous");
document.head.appendChild(script);
